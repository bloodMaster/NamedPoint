# NamedPoint

Write a NamedPoint class with three members: 
two floating point values for the coordinates on an X-Y plane, and a name represented as a 'char *'. 
Assume that this class will be used for some sort of war-game or simulation program that treats the world as flat 
and that these named points will be used to represent things like cities, battlefields, etc.
